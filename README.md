made an angular component whose input is customizable

I did not make the table itself customizable i.e., columns, rows, pagination

    - ideally I'd want to make the table and it's contents completely customizable via inputs
    - I'd also make pagination available for tables and with a default # of rows set and allow users to modify that as well
    - and then we'd build custom features on top of the generic table

satisfied all the requirements
